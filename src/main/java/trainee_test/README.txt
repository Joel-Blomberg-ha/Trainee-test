so hello this is Joel Blomberg writing and this is my attempt at solving the crosskey trainee assignment that was issued 4 February 2022
--
I have been writing this code in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.1 like we have done in most our assignments while studying
and in order to run it you should be able to compile and run it through main that calls on another class.
--
Though to run it you will need to change the File path in Read_function --> first_read() to wherever you have "prospects.txt".
--
Most of the project code is in the Read_function class but that is more because of unfortunate struggles than anything else since the main struggle was extracting the information
needed from the "prospects.txt" file you provided. It had some intentional inconsistencies in it that became much more of a challenge than I originally thought.
Despite this I feel like I have come up with a fairly flexible solution to the issue even though it's not as pretty as I would like it.

and sadly I noticed the issue with the circumflex symbol --> ^  far to late. I didn't have time to find a solution to the issue but as you can see in one of my comments
it seems to most likely be due to it having some special  meaning in Java that I was unaware of.
--
If there is anny confusion on how to activate the application or if I have missed to mention something you need from me please contact me through this email: joel.blombergm@gmail.com
I look forward to hearing from you and look forward to hearing what your thoughts and criticisms on this solution are.
Thank you for your time and have a good day.
