so hello this is Joel Blomberg writing and this is my attempt at solving the crosskey trainee assingnment that was issued 4 February 2022
--
I have been writing this code in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.1 like we have done in most our assignments while studying
and in order to run it you should be able to compile and run it through main that calls on the other classes.
--
Though to run it you will need to change the File path in Read_function --> first_read() to wherever you have "prospects.txt".
--
Most of the project code is in the Read_function class but that is more because of unfortunate struggles than anything else since the main struggle was extracting the information
needed from the "prospects.txt" file you provided.
